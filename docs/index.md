## ArchitectSteve
Steve had spent his whole life successful maze critic. Day after day, Steve spent his time running from maze to maze, occasionally spending time on his hobbies of crafting and street fighting, but it was never long before he was forced to go off and review the next maze. No matter how many times he made it through or got stuck it seemed that there was never a shortage of people eager to have Steve test out their mazes.

One day, Steve couldn’t take it anymore and he ran off to take his very first vacation. Steve was so excited to be free from the mazes he was about to enter in a completely new maze-less world. There wasn’t a hedge or stone-walled path as far as the eye could see. This was the first time Steve had ever seen such large and intricate buildings. It was love at first sight.

Enamored with the sights of the city, Steve new that there was only one thing to do. He walked straight into the top architecture school in the city and sat down. Steve devoted his time towards learning everything that could and began dreaming of building his own beautiful maze-less buildings.

Steve barely graduated from school before he landed a job at the top architecture firm in the city. He was very excited to be done with judging mazes but he still wanted more. After building a rather impressive portfolio, it was time for Steve to go out on his own and realize his new dream of running his own practice

Finally, after a lot of hard work and patience, Steve made it! He began his own architecture office in the city over-looking the beautiful skyline and he never reviewed another maze again!
